Presentation Name: Get Informed About Life Expectancy in the United States

What it's about:
Our app looks at life expectancy in the US through different elements: income, race, insurance coverage, and state information.


Other information:

Data comes from a variety of sources. In some instances, we were not able to include the full range of available years for a dataset because the other variables did not go back as far.

This was made primarily on a Mac device. We found that .csv files may not translate well to Windows operating systems.
